Tracing (non-contact based tracing) and modeling covid-19 with the aim to curb its spread.

Under the current difficult circumstances of corona virus (COVID-19), our first thought is the safety of all.  ​Tracing outbreaks could be another effective measure to curb the spread of covid-19, in addition to physical distancing. These are some illustrations that we have been working, for which the scripts are available at OperAI GitHub. The same scripts can be used, by any one, at a much more granular scale, such as a city with the aim for a near real-time tracing.

Slowing the virus spread is as important as stopping it. The aim of this project is to trace and model the spread while preserving privacy of both individuals and organisations.

Tracing and modeling can be as effective as physical distancing to curb the COVID-19 spread, based on privacy-preserving approaches. One of such approaches has been proposed by experts on privacy matters, in Europe. They called it "Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT)" to help curb the spread with confidentiality. https://lnkd.in/fy3-MB3 / https://lnkd.in/f9etcRp

The approach we have used to trace and model the spread is also a privacy-preserving approach as non-contact based approach. The scripts in preparation are made available at https://lnkd.in/fvF3_fm. They will be constantly updated along with the data.

Such privacy-preserving approaches and scripts can be used at a finer scale with granular data (city/province), to trace and model the spread locally and possibly hourly. Privacy-preserving approaches include individual privacy as well as organization privacy.

Models can help to catch up and curb the spread and avert surges, if any. https://lnkd.in/ehfyuUZ. Earlier, models have shown that by acting just a week earlier, 67% of infections would have been avoided. That number would have reached 95% of reduced infections, with the same protective measures, if they had been applied three weeks earlier. https://lnkd.in/evKXJ2G.
